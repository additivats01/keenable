|⑻|**Description** |Internet services was not working when i tried to connect to wifi it prompted me to a login page where it showed that due to no recharge my services has been terminated. A week prior to this an employee from the Rahul cable tv had visited my home for collecting the fees for internet and i had given him the money myself. So i contacted the shop owner and told him details about the incident and after checking at his end he found that his employee forget to add money to there server which resulted in this. So he apolized for his employee and fixed the problem in just 2 minutes after our conversation.|
